## Explanation of the code

The code is a implementation of a function `nodeDepths` that calculates the sum of the depths of all the nodes in a binary tree. The binary tree is represented using a custom `BinaryTree` class.

```python
def nodeDepths(root):
    sum = 0
    return nodeDepthHelper(root, sum)
```


The nodeDepths function takes in the root of the binary tree and calls the nodeDepthHelper function to calculate the sum of the depths of all the nodes in the binary tree.

```python
def nodeDepthHelper(root, sum, depth=0):
    if root is None:
        return sum
    else:
        sum += depth
        sum = nodeDepthHelper(root.left, sum, depth + 1)
        sum = nodeDepthHelper(root.right, sum, depth + 1)

    return sum
```

The nodeDepthHelper function takes in a node, a sum, and the depth of the node as parameters.

It checks if the node is None. If it is, it returns the sum. If it's not, it adds the depth to the sum, and then recursively calls itself for the left and right children of the node, incrementing the depth by 1 each time.

Finally, the nodeDepthHelper function returns the sum

```python
# This is the class of the input binary tree.
class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
```
