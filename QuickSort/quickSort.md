# Quick Sort Tutorial

Quick sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements in an array or list. It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted.

## How Quick Sort Works

1. Pick a pivot element from the array.
2. Partition the array around the pivot element, such that all elements less than the pivot are to its left, and all elements greater than the pivot are to its right.
3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot.

## Implementing Quick Sort in Python

Here's an implementation of quicksort in Python:

```python
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[0]
    left = []
    right = []
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < pivot:
            left.append(arr[i])
        else:
            right.append(arr[i])
    return quicksort(left) + [pivot] + quicksort(right)

my_list = [4, 2, 8, 5, 1, 3, 7, 6]
print(quicksort(my_list))

```

This code will output:

```python

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

```

In this implementation, we first check if the array has one or fewer elements, in which case it is already sorted. We then select the pivot element as the first element in the array, and partition the array around it by creating two sub-arrays: one for elements less than the pivot, and one for elements greater than or equal to the pivot. We then recursively apply quicksort to each of the sub-arrays and concatenate the sorted results together.

## Conclusion

Quick sort is a fast and efficient sorting algorithm that is widely used in practice. Although it has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), its average-case time complexity is O(n log n), making it a good choice for large datasets.
