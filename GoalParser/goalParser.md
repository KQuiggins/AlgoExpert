# Solving the Goal Parser Problem

The "Goal Parser" problem involves parsing a given string and replacing certain patterns with specific characters. Here's the problem statement:

Given a string `command` consisting of `"G"`, `"()"`, and `"(al)"` in some order, write a function `interpret(command)` that returns a string representing the parsed version of the `command`.

For example, given the input string `"G()()()()(al)"`, the function should return the output string `"Gooooal"`.

## Breaking Down the Problem

To solve this problem, we need to first understand the rules for replacing the patterns in the input string. According to the problem statement, we need to replace:

- `"()"` with the character `"o"`
- `"(al)"` with the characters `"al"`
- `"G"` with the character `"G"`

Given these rules, we can write a function to parse the input string and replace the patterns accordingly.

## Writing the Solution

Here's one possible solution to the problem:

```python
def interpret(command: str) -> str:
    commandString = ""
    parser_dict = {
        "G": "G",
        "()": "o",
        "(al)": "al"
    }
    previous = ""
    for c in command:
        if c == "(":
            previous = c
        elif c == "a" and previous == "(":
            previous += c
        elif c == "l" and previous == "(a":
            previous += c
        elif c == ")":
            commandString += parser_dict[previous + c]
            previous = ""
        else:
            commandString += parser_dict[c]

    return commandString

command = "G()()()()(al)"
results = interpret(command)
print(results)

```

In this solution, we first define a dictionary parser_dict that maps each pattern to its corresponding replacement string. We also define a variable previous to keep track of the current pattern we are parsing.

We then loop through each character in the input string command and check if it matches one of the patterns. If it does, we update the previous variable accordingly. If it doesn't, we add the corresponding replacement string to the commandString variable.

Finally, we return the parsed string commandString.

## Conclusion

The "Goal Parser" problem involves parsing a given string and replacing certain patterns with specific characters. By breaking down the problem into smaller steps and defining a set of rules for replacing the patterns, we can write a function to solve the problem efficiently.
